# Memo  -  List of useful commands or tricks

This repository contains a bunch of memos about various tricks, processes or linux commands, that I have a hard time to remember. Sometimes because I don't use them daily and sometimes because even after using them so many times, I am still mixing the options. Then, there are those I remember perfectly but I prefer to store them somewhere, just in case. I will update the list from time to time.

I leave the memo public: 

- Firstly, because there are no state secrets, 
- Secondly, that could be useful for people who will accidentally stop by on my page ;)
         
    ==> Feel free to use them !
